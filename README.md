I saw a great [Nam June Paik](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nam_June_Paik) video installation in the [Smithsonian American Art Museum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_American_Art_Museum).

I also saw a cool piece of graffiti in Paris of the world, and I created [my own version of it](http://codepen.io/malrase/details/bvHhi/).

I decided to mash these two ideas together, creating a pixelated map of the U.S.A. with each state represented by a gif. Along with [Smith Schwartz](https://github.com/smithschwartz), I chose gifs that represented what first came into our heads when we thought about the state â€“ ranging from famous people from that state, to food, or famous films set there.
